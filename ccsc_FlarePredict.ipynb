    "Solar flares, the largest explosive events in our solar system, are intense bursts of radiation that occur in the Sun's atmosphere and release massive amounts of energy into space. They last from minutes to hours and are often seen as bright chromospheric ribbons and hot coronal loops on the Sun. Some flares are small and innocent while others can be tremendous and violent. Powerful flares and the often accompanied coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can cause severe influences on the near-Earth environment, resulting in potentially life-threatening consequences (Daglis et al. 2004). Therefore, substantial efforts are being invested on solar-flare research including forecast and mitigation plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we attempt to use SDO/HMI vector magnetic field data together with flaring history to predict solar flares that would occur in an AR within 24 hr of a given time point, with a deep-learning method, named long short-term memory (LSTM; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997)."
